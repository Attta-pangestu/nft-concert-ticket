### TicketMaster Web3 Clone Documentation

#### Overview

The TicketMaster Web3 Clone is a decentralized application (dApp) that replicates the functionality of TicketMaster using Web3 technologies. This project leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient ticketing system. 

#### Features

- **Decentralized Ticketing**: Leveraging Ethereum blockchain to issue and verify tickets.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes smart contracts to handle ticket sales and transfers.
- **User Authentication**: Integration with Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for user authentication.
- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface built with modern web technologies.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat
- MetaMask or any other Web3 wallet

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aldoprogrammer/ticketmaster-web3-clone.git
   cd ticketmaster-web3-clone
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   Ensure you have a local Ethereum node running or configure a testnet/mainnet deployment.
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### Project Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts.
- **scripts/**: Deployment scripts for smart contracts.
- **src/**: Source code for the frontend application.
  - **components/**: React components.
  - **pages/**: Application pages.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **test/**: Smart contract tests.
- **public/**: Static assets.

#### Smart Contract Overview

The primary smart contract `TicketMaster.sol` includes functions for:

- Creating events
- Purchasing tickets
- Transferring tickets
- Verifying ticket ownership

#### Configuration

Configure the `hardhat.config.js` file to set up network settings and other configurations.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    },
    // Add other network configurations here
  }
};
```

#### Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### Usage

1. **Connecting Wallet**: Users need to connect their Web3 wallet to interact with the dApp.
2. **Creating Events**: Event organizers can create new events by providing necessary details.
3. **Buying Tickets**: Users can purchase tickets for events through the dApp.
4. **Transferring Tickets**: Ticket holders can transfer their tickets to other users.
